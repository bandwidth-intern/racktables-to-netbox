# racktables-to-netbox
Messy script to export Racktables data, accessible through a SQL connection, into a Netbox instance, accessible at a URL.
Some benefits of Betbox are a strictly enforced naming and relationship hierarchy, custom scripts, cutom reports, easy REST API with many wrappers (like this one)[https://github.com/jagter/python-netbox].
